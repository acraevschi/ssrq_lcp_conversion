~~Get rid of `hi` attribute in annotations. ~~
~~For place names and person names, write actual names~~ ~~Need to check `id` numbering and double check column names.~~
~~Check `term` and `term_ref`~~ ~~Get rid of it for now, as it's a bit difficult to pull out info from the website (https://termini.ssrq-sds-fds.ch/search/search-form.xq)~~
TODO: Better tokenization needed
TODO: Handle `document.csv` non-categorical attributes (making them categorical probably best)
