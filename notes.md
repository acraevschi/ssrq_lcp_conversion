~~Get rid of `hi` attribute in annotations. ~~
~~For place names and person names, write actual names~~ Need to check `id` numbering and double check column names.
~~Check `term` and `term_ref`~~ Get rid of it for now, as it's a bit difficult to pull out info from the website (https://termini.ssrq-sds-fds.ch/search/search-form.xq)
TODO: Better tokenization needed
TODO: What's with the `date`? Potentially get rid of it
